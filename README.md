🏥 Emergency Department Wait Time & Patient Flow Analysis
📁 Repository Description

This repository documents a healthcare data analytics project focused on analyzing emergency department (ED) wait times and patient flow performance across multiple hospitals. The project applies Excel, Power Query, and Power BI to uncover operational bottlenecks, staffing inefficiencies, and their impact on patient satisfaction and outcomes.

📌 Project Overview

Emergency departments often experience overcrowding and long wait times, which can negatively affect patient experience and clinical outcomes. This project explores ED operational data to understand how time patterns, staffing levels, hospital capacity, and patient urgency influence wait times and patient flow.

The analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making for improving emergency care efficiency while demonstrating practical, entry-level healthcare analytics skills.

🎯 Project Objectives

Analyze emergency department wait time trends by time of day, day of week, month, and season

Compare emergency wait times across hospitals and regions (urban vs rural)

Examine the impact of staffing levels on emergency department performance

Identify which phase of care contributes most to overall wait time

Evaluate the relationship between wait times, patient satisfaction, and outcomes

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Excel – data cleaning, KPI calculations, exploratory analysis

Power Query – data transformation and date table creation

Power BI – data modeling, DAX measures, interactive dashboards

📊 Key Metrics Analyzed

Total patients

Average total wait time

Time to registration, triage, and medical professional

Nurse-to-patient ratio

Specialist availability

Bed capacity

Admission, discharge, and LWBS (Left Without Being Seen) rates

Patient satisfaction score

🔍 Key Insights

Emergency department wait times peak during afternoons and evenings, especially on weekdays.

Urban hospitals experience longer average wait times compared to rural hospitals due to higher patient volume.

Lower nurse-to-patient ratios are strongly associated with increased wait times.

Medical professional time is the largest contributor to total wait time, compared to registration and triage.

Critical patients are consistently prioritized with shorter wait times across all hospitals.

Longer wait times reduce patient satisfaction and increase the likelihood of patients leaving without being seen.

Seasonal trends show higher patient volumes and wait times during winter and fall.

💡 Recommendations

Align nurse and specialist staffing schedules with peak demand periods.

Improve throughput during the medical consultation phase to reduce bottlenecks.

Implement proactive staffing and capacity planning during high-demand seasons.

Monitor wait time KPIs to reduce patient walk-outs and improve satisfaction.
